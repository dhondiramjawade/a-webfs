# Angular web folder stucture (a-webfs).

This is a angular web repository to standardize angular small and enterprise (large scale) web application. 
As i'm growing in web enterprise industries I observed that every organization fallow there own path and surprising thing is nearly 70% to 80% concepts, folder structure and implementation are same. They may follow different naming convention but idealogy is approximately same. 

So here we can thing, discusses and create a one template with all meaningful insights and naming conventions. 
I request all web developers to add their insights, strategies for any kind of web development which may includes module strategy, micro front-end, CRED implementation, etc.
